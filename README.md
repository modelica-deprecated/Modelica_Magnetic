# Modelica_Magnetic

Free library for modelling of electromagnetic devices with lumped magnetic networks. (Still using Modelica Standard Library 2.2.1!) This library is included in the Modelica Standard Library since version 3.1.

## Library description

This library from Thomas B&ouml;drich (Dresden University of Technology, Institute of Electromechanical and Electronic Design), contains components for modelling of electromagnetic devices with lumped magnetic networks. Those models are suited for both rough design of the magnetic subsystem of a device as well as for efficient dynamic simulation at system level together with neighbouring subsystems. At present, components and examples for modelling of translatory electromagnetic and electrodynamic actuators are provided. If needed, these components can be adapted to network modellling of rotational electrical machines.
